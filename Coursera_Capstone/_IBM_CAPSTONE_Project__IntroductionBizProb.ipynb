    "With the global population expanding and industrialisation rising in developing nations, humanityâ€™s hunger for energy has reached unprecedented levels. \n",
    "Today, 80% of the world's electrical production comes from fossil and nuclear fuels, and virtually all transportation is fueled by liquid petroleum derivates.\n",
    "The emissions from the burning of fossil and nuclear fuels creates atmospheric, water, land pollution and toxic waste. This combustion is causing a discernible change of the global weather and climate patterns that will affect all humanity in decades to come. \n",

    "\n",
    "Energy sustainability is a global problem, the use and cost of energy affects each of us every day of our lives. This is an educational problem derived from an anachronistic but still active capitalistic lifestyle. We should adapt ourselves to our present days, face our needs and start addressing this problem with local tiny actions. In this case the model aims to identify, and therefore predict, peaks on electricity consumption on the Autonomous Community of Galicia in Spain.\n",
